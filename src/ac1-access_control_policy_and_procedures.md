Supplemental Guidance: This control addresses the establishment of policy and procedures for the
effective implementation of selected security controls and control enhancements in the AC family.
Policy and procedures reflect applicable federal laws, Executive Orders, directives, regulations,
policies, standards, and guidance. Security program policies and procedures at the organization
level may make the need for system-specific policies and procedures unnecessary. The policy can
be included as part of the general information security policy for organizations or conversely, can
be represented by multiple policies reflecting the complex nature of certain organizations. The
procedures can be established for the security program in general and for particular information
systems, if needed. The organizational risk management strategy is a key factor in establishing
policy and procedures. Related control: PM-9.
